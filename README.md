# 🏭 Production Plan Optimization (Cost-Aware Scheduling)

This project focuses on **optimizing production scheduling** to minimize costs while meeting demand and resource constraints.  
It applies **operations research + machine learning techniques** using **Google OR-Tools** and **Python** for real-world decision-making in manufacturing/operations planning.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Minimize total production and operational cost by scheduling tasks efficiently.
- **Techniques Used:** Linear Programming, Mixed Integer Optimization, Cost-Aware Scheduling.
- **Key Tools:** Python, Google OR-Tools, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Input**
   - Production tasks, costs, and time requirements.
   - Resource constraints (machines, labor hours, raw materials).
   - Demand requirements for each product.
2. **Optimization Model**
   - Decision variables: task allocation across time periods.
   - Constraints: demand fulfillment, capacity limits, cost restrictions.
   - Objective function: minimize total cost.
3. **Results & Visualization**
   - Optimized production schedule.
   - Cost savings vs baseline.
   - Gantt chart visualization of task allocations.

---

## 📊 Sample Output
- Optimized cost reduced by **22%** compared to baseline.
- Gantt chart showing production schedule across time periods.
- Sensitivity analysis for demand and resource variations.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, OR-Tools, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add support for stochastic demand scenarios.
- Incorporate multi-objective optimization (cost + time + energy efficiency).
- Deploy as a web dashboard (Flask/Django + Streamlit).
